# Advanced Audio System

Check out my other starter resources on [GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/Unity-Quick-Starters/dashboard)

Most of this code I extracted from [Unity's Chop Chop](https://github.com/UnityTechnologies/open-project-1) project.

I fixed naming and some poor styling. I also replaced their delegates with my EventRequest type.

I tried to separate out the audio system to just the required bits.

Feel free to delete everything under the sample folder but you might want to try out the demo scene first.

If I get time, I'll try to document this more.

I'm willing to try to fix critical bugs, but I don't intend to really maintain the beyond anything I need to do for a separate closed source project.~~~~
